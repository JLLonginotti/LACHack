# LACHack
USAID Latin America and Caribbean Open Data Hackathon 2015.

LACHack 2015 will look at USAID funding flows and target the issue of crime and violence to determine what information USAID has collected and shared publicly, how this information compares and is supported by high quality open datasets such as AmericaBarometer, and determine what additional datasets would be needed for improved policy and programmatic decision-making. Any models of combining these datasets will be used to inform USAID of how to utilize historical data from its fifty years of programming, and what changes can be made to how USAID collects and shares data in future programming
