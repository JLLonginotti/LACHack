USAID Latin America and Caribbean Open Data Hackathon 2015
The three hackathon groups are as follows:
Official USAID Data: A look at Mexico since the 1980s through funding, projects, and evaluation reports.
Social Media and USAID funded America's Barometer Public Opinion Data: What can they tell us about patterns of crime and hotspot targetting?
Shadow data: Using nontraditional data to understand crime and insecurity - innovating third party data to read between the lines of official data, social media data, and public opinion data.
